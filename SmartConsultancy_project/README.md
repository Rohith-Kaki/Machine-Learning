## **INTRODUCTION**
This research explores various Machine Learning (ML) techniques applied to real-world data analysis and prediction problems. The study focuses on four essential ML functionalities, each solving a practical problem scenario relevant to smart consultancy.

## **TASKS & MACHINE LEARNING APPLICATIONS**

### **1. CLUSTERING & RANKING**
- **Ranking:** Extracting scores from datasets using statistical algorithms.
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points using Cluster Analysis.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of input features (variables) to improve efficiency.

### **2. FLOWCHART FOR FUEL CONSUMPTION PREDICTION**
- Uses **Regression Analysis** to estimate vehicle fuel efficiency based on vehicle specifications.
- Helps optimize fuel usage and cost.

### **3. ANALYZING TENNIS PLAY FREQUENCY**
- ML techniques analyze how frequently people play tennis based on weather conditions.
- Achieved **75% accuracy** in predicting tennis play frequency.

### **4. POLYNOMIAL REGRESSION FOR TRACTOR MAINTENANCE**
- **Polynomial Regression** is applied to analyze tractor maintenance trends based on age data.

#### **Results:**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 10,937.08
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 85.77
- **R-Squared Score:** 0.867
